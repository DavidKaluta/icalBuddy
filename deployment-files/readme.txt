INSTALLATION:
--------------------------------

To install, just double-click on the "install.command" file in Finder (it might
just say "install" if your Finder preferences are set to hide file extensions.)

This script will then be run in Terminal and it will first display you the
locations where icalBuddy will be installed to and then prompt you to continue.




HELP / GETTING STARTED:
--------------------------------

After installation you can:

* Read the FAQ by opening the "faq.html" file in your web browser.

* Run "man icalBuddy" in the terminal to read the program's manual page.
  Here you'll find documentation for all of the arguments you can use
  when calling icalBuddy.

* Run "man icalBuddyConfig" in the terminal to read the manual page
  for the configuration file format. Here you'll find documentation
  for everything you can do with the configuration file in order
  to make icalBuddy always behave in the way you want.

* Copy one of the included example localization files to
  ~/.icalBuddyLocalization.plist in order to start using them. This
  is only if you're interested in making icalBuddy output in a
  language other than english.

* Run "man icalBuddyLocalization" in the terminal to read the localization
  manual page. This is if you're interested in writing your own
  localization(s).

All of the three icalBuddy manual pages are also available as PDFs
for your viewing pleasure.
